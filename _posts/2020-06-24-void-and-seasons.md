*Mountains*

The mountains wait for sin

A Sun rises in the east  
bearing fruit and wine and glory.  
The mountains scoff,  
Sun, you terrible pest.  

The days come and go.  
The rivers flow.  
The grasses bring flowers.  
The village brings towers.  

The mountains cry,  
Sun, you terrible pest!  
You bring these fools--  
This sordid flesh and endless flora.  

The Sun is patient,  
The Sun is kind.  
And when the mountains sleep,  
A dawn breaks.

And the Sun also riseth.

*Heart*
  
My heart  
and blisters  
My head  
and whispers  

The blood and thought of wolf and lamb  
In holy mountains, spread like dawn  
Amongst the grey of fallen flesh  
  
My heart  
and grace  
My head  
and space

*Void*

No words to write  
No darkness to light  

No death to mourn  
No lover to scorn  

No snake and no dove  
No hate and no love  

No sound and no fury  
No judge and no jury  

No pity and no spite  
No may and no might
